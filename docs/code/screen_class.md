# Summary

---

The LoseScreen class in Python, using Pygame, manages the display and interaction for a game over screen. It shows a message to the player and waits for specific key inputs to either quit the game or restart it. It also allows toggling of music and sound settings if a sound object is provided.
### Example Usage
```
import pygame
from colors import COLORS

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
loose_screen = LoseScreen(screen, COLORS)
game_over = loose_screen.show()
if game_over:
    pygame.quit()
else:
    # Restart the game
```
