# Summary

---

The Snake class represents a snake in a game, managing its movement, growth, direction, and rendering on the screen. It uses Pygame for handling directions and drawing the snake segments.

### Example Usage
```
import pygame
from snake import Snake

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600, 400))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

snake = Snake()

running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            snake.change_direction(event.key)

    snake.move()
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    snake.draw(screen)
    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(10)

pygame.quit()
```
## Code Analysis

---

### Main functionalities
- Manage the snake's segments and movement.
- Handle the snake's growth and trimming.
- Change the snake's direction based on user input.
- Render the snake on the game screen.

---

### Methods
- __init__(self, cell_size=10): Initializes the snake with a default cell size and initial segments.
- move(self): Moves the snake in the current direction.
- grow(self, growth=1): Increases the length of the snake by a specified growth amount.
- trim_length(self, new_length=5): Trims the snake's length to a specified new length.
- change_direction(self, direction): Changes the snake's direction based on user input.
- draw(self, surface): Draws the snake on the given surface.

---

### Fields
- cell_size: The size of each segment of the snake.
- segments: A list of tuples representing the positions of the snake's segments.
- direction: The current direction of the snake's movement.
- colors: A list of color keys used to color the snake's segments.
